# Drug Trafficking Detection on Encrypted Apps

## Overview
This project aims to combat the rising misuse of encrypted messaging and social media apps like Telegram, WhatsApp, and Instagram for drug trafficking in India. 
Drug traffickers are exploiting these platforms to sell dangerous synthetic drugs (e.g., MDMA, LSD, Mephedrone) through channels, bots, and handles.
 Our goal is to develop a software solution to detect these activities and trace identifiable details like IP addresses or mobile numbers.

## Problem Statement
Encrypted apps are being used to:
- Market and sell narcotic and psychotropic substances.
- Communicate covertly via channels, Telegram bots, and Instagram handles.
This poses a serious challenge to law enforcement and public safety in India.

## Proposed Solution
Weâ€™re building a software tool to:
1. Identify live Telegram channels, WhatsApp groups, and Instagram handles involved in drug trafficking.
2. Triangulate user details (e.g., IP addresses, mobile numbers, email IDs) for tracking by authorities.

## Goals
- Create an effective detection system using modern tech (e.g., AI, web scraping).
- Support collaboration between team members via Git and GitHub.
- Contribute to safer digital spaces in India.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repo**: `git clone https://github.com/prasanth237280/drug-trafficking-system_ccp_project.git`
2. **Navigate**: `cd DrugTraffickingDetection`
3. **Contribute**: Add your code, docs, or ideas, then push to GitHub!
